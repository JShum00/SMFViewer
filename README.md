# üß≠ Python-SMF Toolkit
**Author:** Johnny Shumway (jShum00)
**License:** MIT
**Version:** 1.0

A reverse-engineered Python toolkit for viewing, parsing, and exporting
**Terminal Reality .SMF model files** used in classic games like *4x4 Evolution 2*.

This toolkit includes:
- **`pysmf.py`** ‚Äì robust SMF parser (extracts vertices, faces, textures, and submeshes)
- **`pysmf-gui.py`** ‚Äì interactive OpenGL viewer using PyGame + Tkinter
- **`pysmf_export.py`** ‚Äì multi-object OBJ exporter (Blender compatible)
- **`pysmf_print.py`** ‚Äì formatted model summary printer

---

## üöÄ Features
- Loads and displays `.SMF` models in real time
- Orbiting camera (arrow keys)
- Progressive submesh draw with pause/resume
- Wireframe toggle
- Direct export to multi-object `.OBJ`
- Human-readable SMF data summary printed to console

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL numpy
```
Tkinter comes pre-installed with most Python distributions.
Tested on Python 3.10+ (Linux).

## üéÆ Controls
Key             Action
- O             Open .SMF file.
- E             Export current model to .OBJ
- W             Toggle wireframe/solid.
- SPACE         Pause or resume progressive drawing.
- ‚Üê / ‚Üí       Orbit camera, left/right.
- ESC           Exit Viewer

## üß© File Overview
pysmf.py

The main parser.
Reads .SMF line-by-line, reconstructs submeshes, textures, and geometry.

pysmf-gui.py

OpenGL viewer built with PyGame and PyOpenGL.
Uses an orbit camera, grid, and incremental draw thread.

pysmf_export.py

Converts .SMF ‚Üí .OBJ, keeping each submesh as a distinct object.
Produces clean, Blender-importable geometry.

pysmf_print.py

Prints structured summary data to the console automatically when models are loaded:

```yaml
============================ SMF MODEL SUMMARY ============================
File: GMCJimmy.smf
Version: 4
Submeshes: 25
Total Vertices: 1837
Textures: GMCJimmy.TIF, GMCJimmy_bump.TIF
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Body         |      427 (hdr:427) verts |      538 (hdr:538) tris | GMCJimmy.TIF, GMCJimmy_bump.TIF
  AxleR        |       68 (hdr:68) verts  |       76 (hdr:76) tris  | GMCJimmy.TIF, GMCJimmy_bump.TIF
=========================================================================
```

## üß± Example Usage
Run the viewer:
```bash
python3 pysmf-gui.py
```
Standalone export:
```bash
python3 pysmf-export.py
```
Print model summary only:
```bash
python3 pysmf_print.py
```

## üß† Notes
The .SMF format was used by Terminal Reality‚Äôs EVO engine (circa 2000s). 
Models may have non-centered origins ‚Äî this viewer recenters them automatically.
Texture and bump map names are parsed but not yet applied in OpenGL.
Wireframe is default for debugging visibility.
