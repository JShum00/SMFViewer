ðŸ”¢ Versions:
    pygame      >= 2.5.2
    PyOpenGL    >= 3.1.7
    numpy       >= 1.26.4

ðŸ§  Notes:
    pygame handles the window, event loop, and OpenGL context.

    PyOpenGL is the OpenGL wrapper for Python â€” required by your viewer.

    numpy is used for vertex math, array handling, and scale computations.

    Tkinter is part of the Python standard library, so it doesnâ€™t need to be listed.

If you want to freeze dependency versions for a release build (for example, when publishing on GitHub), you can run:

    pip freeze | grep -E 'pygame|PyOpenGL|numpy' > requirements.txt

That will write exact version numbers for your current environment.
